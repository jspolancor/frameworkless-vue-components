# Frameworkless vue components

How to reuse vue components in another frameworks.

## Web components

Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable 
custom elements, with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code
and utilize them in your web apps:

```html
<this-is-my-element foo="bar"><this-is-my-element>
```

Most frameworks implement their own components approach.

The only framework that compiles to native web components is ![Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/).

## vue-custom-element

[vue-custom-element](https://github.com/karol-f/vue-custom-element) is a tiny wrapper around Vue components
